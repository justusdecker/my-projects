Living in a Movie
You're now going to start your first project ðŸŽŠ
This exercise is the first step of the project. 
In the upcoming units you'll take the code that you wrote here and extend it to support additional features.

We're building a movie application. Your movie application will store movie names and their ratings.
You will communicate with the user via a command line, i.e., you print information to the terminal and expect user input.
Your application will support two types of commands:

1. CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete

Almost every application implements CRUD commands, since you want to add movies (Create), view the existing movies (Read), update movies (Update), and delete movies (Delete).
You can read more about CRUD in this link, or just Google it.

2. Analytics

Analytics, such as getting the top-rated movie, the least-rated movie etc.

Movie Data Structure

You will store the movies in a dictionary, provided to you in the skeleton file movies.py. 
ach key in the dictionary stores the movie name, and each value stores the movieâ€™s rating.

Menu

When opening the application on the first time, your application should display a title of your application (for example, My Movies Database).
After the title, a menu should be displayed with the different options in your applications. 
Each menu item is printed with a number next to it. Then, the user is requested to enter a choice from the menu.
